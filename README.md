Odin-Recipes 

A website that contains the collection of the recipes that was cooked by Mr. Odin himself because he didn't like what Frigg cooked for him. So one day he decided to be kind and share all his secret recipes across different pages of the website. Each recipe is well defined and organized with ingredients and method to cook just like the gods.
